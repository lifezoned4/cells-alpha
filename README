Cells Prototype Startup
-----------------------
1. Check for dart-sdk
1.1 If ./sdks/<your-system-folder>/ is emptry Download
 dart-sdk 1.9.1 from https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html.
1.2 Place the content of the zip in the ./sdks/<your-system-folder>/
2. Run specific script for your system (For Example: ./linux64_start.sh)
3. dartvm should now have launched cellserver/cellsComm.dart and opened
the ports 8086 (for WebSocket communication) and 8087 (for static Webserver hosting)
3.1 Navigate to http://localhost:8087/cellsweb.html
4. You can use the user:test password:test to login by default.

Manual
------
Single User Mode:
-----------------
The Modell is configured by default for a single user mode.
The Buttons DemoSeed DemoRND and DemoUR are used to demonstrate Experiments.
DemoRND and DemoUR are the two examples used in the thesis.
They should give allways the same result and finish in the same state.
DemoSeed rendomly seeds the system with Ur-Cells.


Saves file folder
----------------
Under ./cellsserver/saves/ there are some configuration files:
createTokens is a newline divided file which can have hex numbers to be
distributed to the users. This numbers are AlphaKeys to create a user in the 
System. 

Example createTokens:
ABCDE123456789
123456789ABCDE
A1B3D3

The world file is the persitent state of the System.
It can be altered before the System comes up and those it is a input path
to the system. It is possible to generate world files by other progems
if someone would like too. The semnatics of the json structe are descirbed
in cellsserver/cellsPersist.dart

worldBreadExperiment and worldRNDExperiment are the worlds loaded by the
buttons in Single user mode.

users is a autogenerted file. Every user who used a alphaKey to register is
put here. Only the public key is stored. Some additional data like last login
are also stored here.

logging is the log file hanc the name

the folder measurments holds cyclic statistic date over time
the structur should be self explaining.
After injecting new greencode a world-snapshot is also created here.


Multiuser Mode
----------------
BEAWARE THAT FOR A MULTI USER MODE SCRIPTS HAVE TO BE CHANGED!

Configure the IP your hosting on in cellsComm.dart. It is a static field
easy to find. Ports can be ajusted here too.

Remove the demo Buttons from cellsweb/build/web/cellsweb.html.

Setup some AlphaKeys and distribute them to users. AlphaKeys are only used once
by a usere to create a password. Tell the users the CANNOT change there password
afterwords.

Reference the user to the help.hmtl file under http://<yourip>:8087/help.html
