  <h1>Cells Help-File: Alpha v2.3</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>There are two kinds of States: Energy (rectangular) and Cell (round).</p>
  <p> Fields which are gray are empty fields </p>
  <p> A cell can move from one field only into a empty field </p>
<p> A Registermaschine is used to dertmin which direction if any will be choosen </p>
<p> Your task will be to move the cell in some directions and after it has collected Energy fields of there compliment color it should start to reproduce </p>
<p> To do so you have to understand how the registermaschine works </p>
<h2>GreenCode Registermachine</h2>
<p> A Reigster maschine is a set of Operations combinded with a set of Registers. A Operation has the structure:
<li>|OperandName| |OperandFlag||Operand:Number|;</li>
</p>
<p> A Example Operation would be LOAD #1; It loads the Constant number 1 into the ALU Register. ALU is the Register 0.</p>
<p> STORE #8; stores the number which is in Register 0 into 
the Register at the number 8. This is a special Register. It determins in which direction the cell will be moving in the next model step. </p>
<br>
<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
Try to start a cell (by selecting energy, putting code into the GreenCode TextBox and press start. Selecting can be done by clicking a rectangle field which is not gray).
After started a cell you do it again but this time type something into the greencode field which will make the cell move.

<h3>Soloution 1</h3>
LOAD #3;
STORE #8;
<br>
<p>
The Content of Register 8 will be interpreted as so:

<li>0: dont move
<li>1: move north
<li>2: move east
<li>3: move south
<li>4: move west
<li>5: dont move
<li>6: move north
</p>
<p> As you can notice the field is moduleted by 5 and the a direction is choosen. </p>

<p>After we learned how to move, we know shall undestand how eating works.</p>

<p>When a green cells is near a blue cell or Energyfield it eats the other field. Same for blue near red. And red near green.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
Try to move a cell in a color to a color it can eat.

<p>To master Exercie 2 we learn know some operations to do more logic</p>

<p> ADD #5; adds the number 5 to the ALU </p>

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
Move your cell in circles
<h3>Solution 3</h3>

ADD #1;
STORE #8;
ADD #1;
STORE #8;
ADD #1;
STORE #8;
ADD #1;
STORE #8;

<h3>Solution 3 alternativ</h3>
ADD #1;
STORE #8;

<p>The alternativ solution uses the registermachine behavior of roundrobbing the operations. When the end of the list is reached its starts at the top again </p>

<p>After you learned the basic concept how the registermachine works dive into the specification. There are many other Operators to be used. Learn them and try them.</p>
